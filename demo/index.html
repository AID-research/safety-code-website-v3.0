		<div class="recommendation-small-text">Reason: CYP2D6 ULTRARAPID METABOLIZER </div>
		<p>The genetic polymorphism leads to increased metabolic capacity of CYP2D6, which may cause a decrease in the plasma concentrations of amitriptyline and its active metabolite nortriptyline and increased plasma concentrations of the active metabolites E-10-OH-amitriptyline and E-10-OH-nortriptyline.</p><p>Recommendation:</p><ol type="1"><li>Choose an alternative if possible<br />Antidepressants that are not metabolised via CYP2D6 - or to a lesser extent - include, for example, citalopram and sertraline.<br /></li><li>If an alternative is not an option: increase the dose to 1.25 times the standard dose, monitor the plasma concentrations and be alert to potential therapy failure due to decreased amitriptyline plus nortriptyline plasma concentrations and to increased plasma concentrations of the potentially cardiotoxic, active hydroxy metabolites.</li></ol><p>Mechanism:<br />Amitriptyline is mainly converted by CYP2C19-mediated N-demethylation to the active metabolite nortriptyline. Both amitriptyline and nortriptyline are metabolised by CYP2D6 to 10-hydroxy metabolites, predominantly E-10-hydroxy metabolites. Amitriptyline is approximately three times as potent as E-10-OH-amitriptyline. Nortriptyline is approximately twice as potent as E-10-OH-nortriptyline.<br />N-oxidation and N-glucuronidation of amitriptyline also take place.<br />Nortriptyline is converted by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 to the inactive metabolite didesmethylamitriptyline (desmethylnortriptyline).<br />For more information about the UM phenotype: see the general background information about CYP2D6 on the KNMP Knowledge Bank or on www.knmp.nl (search for key word &#8220;pharmacogenetics&#8221;).</p><p>Other considerations:<br />The therapeutic efficacy of amitriptyline correlates with the sum of the plasma concentrations of amitriptyline and nortriptyline, but side effects correlate with nortriptyline plasma concentrations.<br />The hydroxy metabolites are potentially cardiotoxic.</p><p>Clinical consequences:<br />One case described therapy failure after an initial short period of improvement.</p><p>Kinetic consequences:<br />A 20% decrease in amitriptyline plus nortriptyline plasma concentrations was found (non-significant).<br />A positive correlation between CYP2D6 activity and (hydroxyamitriptyline + hydroxynortriptyline)/(amitriptyline + nortriptyline) ratio was also found. This means that there is a relative increase in hydroxy metabolites in UM patients.<br />A 47% increase in the amitriptyline/nortriptyline metabolic ratio was found (non-significant).</p>

		<div class="recommendation-small-text">Reason: CYP2D6 ULTRARAPID METABOLIZER </div>
		<p>The genetic variation results in an increased conversion of atomoxetine to the active metabolite 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, which has a much lower plasma concentration. As the plasma concentration of the active ingredients decreases as a result, this gene variation can result in reduced efficacy.</p><p>Recommendation:</p><ol type="1"><li>be extra alert to reduced efficacy of the treatment<br /></li><li>advise the patient to contact their doctor in the event of inadequate effect<br /></li><li>an alternative can be selected as a precaution<br /> Clonidine is not metabolised by CYP2D6.</li></ol><p>Mechanism:<br />Atomoxetine is primarily metabolised by CYP2D6 to 4-hydroxyatomoxetine. This metabolite is equipotent to atomoxetine, but circulates in much lower concentrations in the plasma.<br />The enzyme CYP2C19 and other iso-enzymes form N-desmethylatomoxetine, which is virtually inactive.<br />For more information about the UM phenotype, see the general background information about CYP2D6 on the KNMP Knowledge Bank or on www.knmp.nl (search for &#8220;CYP2D6&#8221;).</p><p>Clinical consequences:<br />Theoretically, the risk of a decreased effectiveness of the therapy increases when the sum of the plasma concentrations of atomoxetine and 4-hydroxyatomoxetine decreases.</p><p>Kinetic consequences:<br />Following a single dose, the AUC of atomoxetine decreased by approximately two thirds for 1 UM with gene dose 3. The concentration of 4-hydroxyatomoxetine was less than 1% of the concentration of atomoxetine, meaning that the contribution of 4-hydroxyatomoxetine was negligible.</p>

				<span class="ui-btn-text">AZATHIOPRINE </h3>
		<div class="recommendation-small-text">Reason: TPMT POOR METABOLIZER </div>
		<p>The genetic variation reduces the conversion of azathioprine and mercaptopurine to mainly inactive metabolites. This increases the risk of serious, life-threatening adverse events such as myelosuppression.</p><p>Recommendation:</p><ol type="1"><li>Choose an alternative or start with 10% of the standard dose.<br /> Any adjustment of the initial dose should be guided by toxicity (monitoring of blood counts) and effectiveness.<br /> The frequency of monitoring should be increased.</li><li>If the dose is decreased: advise patients to seek medical attention when symptoms of myelosuppression (such as severe sore throat in combination with fever, regular nosebleeds and tendency to bruising) occur</li></ol><p>Mechanism:<br />Azathioprine is converted in the body to mercaptopurine. Mercaptopurine is an inactive pro-drug, which is converted to the active metabolites - thioguanine nucleotides - in the body. Two catabolic routes reduce mercaptopurine bio-availability for thioguanine nucleotide formation. Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) catalyses S-methylation of both mercaptopurine and the 6-mercaptopurine ribonucleotides formed in the metabolic pathway. In addition to this, mercaptopurine is oxidised to the inactive 6-thiouric acid by the enzyme xanthine oxidase (XO), which occurs primarily in the liver and intestines. For more information about the PM phenotype: see the general background information about TPMT on the KNMP Knowledge Bank or on www.knmp.nl (search for key word &#8220;pharmacogenetics&#8221;).</p><p>Clinical consequences:<br />In eleven out of sixteen cases, the standard dose resulted in termination of treatment due to leukopaenia/myelosuppression. Four patients underwent significant dose reduction due to leukopaenia/myelosuppression and/or high concentrations of the active metabolite. One PM developed only mild toxicity at the standard dose. A meta-analysis involving 43 PM with cancer found that 86% developed severe myelosuppression (in comparison to 7% for all genotypes). In a meta-analysis with 7 PM with auto-immune diseases, the risk of leukopaenia increased (OR = 20.84; 95% CI: 3.42-126.89). In this meta-analysis there was no difference in the risk of other adverse events (myelotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis). The tolerated dose varied for 27 PM from 2.2%-20% of the standard dose (mean 10%). One PM tolerated a dose of 124% of the standard dose. One study found a comparable clinical response (some remaining leukaemia cells) in PM at 10% of the standard dose as for EM at 100%. Another study found a good clinical response (improvement of ulcerative colitis) at 2.2% of the standard dose.</p><p>Kinetic consequences:<br />In one study, the concentration of the active metabolite was 8.5-fold higher in comparison to EM at 14% of the dose. In one patient at 5% of the dose, the concentration of the active metabolite was 4.6-fold higher and in one patient at 20% of the dose, the concentration was 5.0-fold higher. One study found a concentration of the active metabolite within the target range at 2.2% of the standard dose. In two cases at 10% of the standard dose, the concentration of the active metabolite was 3.4-4.3 times the postulated therapeutic lower limit. In one case, the dose-corrected concentration of the active metabolite was increased by a factor of seven.</p>

				<span class="ui-btn-text">CITALOPRAM </h3>
		<div class="recommendation-small-text">Reason: CYP2C19 POOR METABOLIZER </div>
		<p>The gene variation leads to increased citalopram plasma concentrations. This increases the risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes.</p><p>Recommendation:</p><ol type="1"><li>do not exceed the following daily doses (50% of the standard maximum dose) or choose an alternative:<ul><li>adults to 65 years: 20 mg as tablets or 16 mg as drops<br /></li><li>adults over 65 years: 10 mg as tablets or 8 mg as drops</li></ul></li></ol><p>Mechanism:<br />Citalopram is primarily metabolised by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 to the weakly active N-desmethylcitalopram. Desmethylcitalopram is converted by CYP2D6 to didesmethylcitalopram.<br />For more information about the PM phenotype: see the general background information about CYP2C19 on the KNMP Knowledge Database or on www.knmp.nl (search for key word &#8220;pharmacogenetics&#8221;).</p><p>Other considerations:<br />The relationship between plasma concentration and efficacy and side effects has not been established. The risk of citalopram-induced QT prolongation and torsades de pointes is dependent on the dose and therefore dependent on the plasma concentration.<br />The upper limit of the therapeutic range of citalopram is 400 ng/mL. Toxicity has been confirmed at citalopram plasma concentrations from 210 ng/mL. In general, therapeutic plasma concentrations of citalopram range between 30 and 130 ng/mL.</p><p>Clinical consequences:<br />A study of sixteen IM patients and one PM found 3.0% longer QTc interval. For this group, the study found no difference in the median dose and the percentage of patients with a dose higher than 40 mg/day.<br />Two studies found no difference in the occurrence of side effects. A study involving newborns, with a group of four IM and one PM, found no difference in the severity of serotonergic symptoms following citalopram use by the mother.<br />There was no difference in tolerance for the PM. For IM+PM, the results for the probability of tolerance varied from no difference in the validation study to a decrease.<br />For the probability of remission, the effect varied from no difference to an increase by 48%.<br />There was no significant effect on the set dose.</p><p>Kinetic consequences:<br />Increase in AUC by 19-119%. The increase in AUC is primarily caused by an increase in the active S-enantiomer: an increase in AUC of the racemate by 19% is equivalent to an increase in the AUC of S-citalopram by 57%.<br />For the plasma concentration, the effect varied from an increase by 64% to a decrease by 6%.<br />Decrease in oral clearance by 24-76%.<br />Increase in half-life by 10-40%.</p><p>This is NOT a gene-drug interaction.</p><p>Mechanism:<br />Citalopram is converted to N-desmethylcitalopram, primarily by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. N-desmethylcitalopram is converted to didesmethylcitalopram by CYP2D6.<br />N-desmethylcitalopram has an antidepressant effect. However, the activity is low and clinically non-significant at standard doses of citalopram.<br />For more information about the UM phenotype: see the general background information about CYP2D6 on the KNMP Knowledge Bank or on www.knmp.nl (search for key word &#8220;pharmacogenetics&#8221;).</p><p>Clinical consequences:<br />One study found no effect on tolerance, response and remission.</p><p>Kinetic consequences:<br />Three studies found no significant effect on the plasma concentration of citalopram.</p>

				<span class="ui-btn-text">CLOMIPRAMINE </h3>
		<div class="recommendation-small-text">Reason: CYP2D6 ULTRARAPID METABOLIZER </div>
		<p>The genetic polymorphism leads to increased metabolic capacity of CYP2D6. This may cause decreased plasma concentrations of clomipramine and the active metabolite and increased concentrations of the potentially cardiotoxic hydroxy metabolites.</p><p>Recommendation:</p><ol type="1"><li>choose an alternative<br />Antidepressants that are not metabolised by CYP2D6, or to a lesser extent, include citalopram and sertraline.</li><li>if an alternative is not an option:<ol type="1"><li>increase the dose to 150% of the standard dose</li><li>monitor the plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine<br />Only clomipramine is relevant for the indications of obsessive compulsive disorder and for other anxiety disorders. Both concentrations are relevant for toxicity and for the indication of depression.</li></ol></li></ol><p>Mechanism:<br />Clomipramine and the active metabolite N-desmethylclomipramine are primarily converted by CYP2D6 to inactive hydroxy metabolites.<br />Clomipramine is mainly converted by CYP2C19 to N-desmethylclomipramine.<br />For more information about the UM phenotype: see the general background information about CYP2D6 on the KNMP Knowledge Bank or on www.knmp.nl (search for key word &#8220;pharmacogenetics&#8221;).</p><p>Other considerations:<br />The inactive hydroxy metabolites are potentially cardiotoxic. More of these hydroxy metabolites are formed in UM and with dose increases, whilst they also accumulate with severe renal function impairment.<br />The active metabolite desmethylclomipramine lacks serotonin re-uptake activity. Therefore, the metabolite does not appear to contribute to the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder and other anxiety disorders. However, the metabolite does contribute to toxicity and the treatment of depression.<br />In the case of depression, a value of 0.2-0.3 mg/L is used for the sum of the plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine. In theory, a value of 0.4 mg/L is used for anxiety disorders. In the case of severe anxiety disorders, the dose can be further increased under strict monitoring of the ECG, up to a sum of the plasma concentrations no greater than 0.7 mg/L. If this still has not produced any effect, fluvoxamine is sometimes added at a low dose (initial dose 50 mg) in order to inhibit the conversion of clomipramine to desmethylclomipramine. There is some experience of this and it does increase the ratio of clomipramine/desmethylclomipramine. In other words, treatment is very much tailored to the individual in the case of anxiety disorders.</p><p>Clinical consequences:<br />In two cases with non-response, an increase in the plasma concentrations through dose increase or CYP2D6 inhibition resulted in recovery of the problem. The dose increase involved an increase from 150 to 300 mg/day. Other reports of dose increases for UM are not known.<br />Theoretically, the risk of side effects due to potentially cardiotoxic hydroxy metabolites increases with an increase in the plasma concentrations.</p><p>Kinetic consequences:<br />One study with 3 UM found a decrease in the dose-corrected plasma concentration of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine by 33%.<br />The same study found a decrease in the dose-corrected plasma concentration of clomipramine by 25%.<br />Unusually low plasma concentrations of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine were observed in two cases.<br />Theoretically, the plasma concentrations of the hydroxy metabolites can increase.</p>

				<span class="ui-btn-text">CLOPIDOGREL </h3>
		<div class="recommendation-small-text">Reason: CYP2C19 POOR METABOLIZER </div>
		<p>Genetic variation reduces activation of clopidogrel. This increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events in patients undergoing balloon angioplasty or stent placement (percutaneous coronary intervention). No negative clinical consequences have been proved in other patients.</p><p>Recommendation:</p><ul><li>PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION:<ol type="1"><li>choose an alternative<br />Prasugrel and ticagrelor are not metabolised by CYP2C19 (or to a lesser extent).</li></ol></li><li>OTHER INDICATIONS:<ol type="1"><li>determine the level of inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel<br /></li><li>consider an alternative in poor responders<br />Prasugrel and ticagrelor are not metabolised by CYP2C19 (or to a lesser extent).</li></ol></li></ul><p>Mechanism:<br />Clopidogrel is a pro-drug, of which 85% is converted by esterases to an inactive metabolite. The remaining 15% is primarily converted by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 to 2-oxoclopidogrel and subsequently to the active metabolite H4, an unstable thiol compound that inhibits platelet aggregation by formation of a disulphide bridge with a cysteine residue on the platelet ADP receptor (P2Y12).<br />For more information about the PM phenotype: see the general background information about CYP2C19 on the KNMP Knowledge Bank or on www.knmp.nl (search for CYP2C19).</p><p>Clinical consequences:<br />Increased incidence of stent thrombosis by 267-425% or OR 3.78. Results ranged from no difference to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events (HRcorr = 1.98 for all patients; HRcorr = 3.58 for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention; OR = 1.59-1.75; RR = non-significant -3.64). The RR was non-significant in a meta-analysis of Caucasian patients, but was significant after exclusion of a large study in which the percentage of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention was 18.7% (RR = 1.57). The RR was also non-significant in a meta-analysis including mainly Caucasian patients (122 PM) not undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The RR among Caucasian patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (278 PM) was 1.67. The RR was higher among East-Asian populations (studies involving percutaneous coronary intervention only): 3.04-3.64.<br />Results ranged from no difference in major bleeding to a decreased risk of all bleeding (OR = 0.36; RR = 0.56).<br />Genotype-guided therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention involving IM patients receiving a double clopidogrel dose and PM patients receiving an alternative (ticagrelor or clopidogrel in combination with cilostazol), led to a reduced incidence of serious cardiovascular events (OR = 0.42 and decrease by 71% respectively) compared to therapy involving all patients receiving clopidogrel 75 mg/day. Genotype-guided therapy in the study using ticagrelor as an alternative did not lead to significant differences in serious cardiovascular events and bleeding between PM, IM and EM patients, while the incidence of death decreased by 89%, of myocardial infarction by 86% and stent thrombosis by 78% in the study using clopidogrel in combination with cilostazol as an alternative.<br />Treatment of PM patients with double dosed clopidogrel for 1 month led to more minor bleeding than treatment with ticagrelor (HR = 2.88). Residual platelet aggregation was higher among the clopidogrel group.<br />Platelet reactivity at the 225 mg/day dose was higher than that of EM+UM patients at the 75 mg/day dose. Non-response defined by platelet reactivity at the 900 mg loading dose was higher than that at the 300 mg loading dose for EM+UM patients. The above applies to patients. The dose response was higher among healthy volunteers.</p><p>Kinetic consequences:<br />The AUC of the active metabolite H4 decreased by 49-72%.<br />The AUC increased by 194%.<br />The AUC of 2-oxoclopidogrel decreased by 43-65%.</p>

Conversion by CYP2D6 results in formation of the active metabolite morphine, which has a 200x higher affinity for the &#181;-opioid receptor than codeine itself. Morphine is further converted to morphine-3-glucuronide and the active morphine-6-glucuronide.<br />For more information about the UM phenotype: see the general background information about CYP2D6 on the KNMP Knowledge Bank.</p><p>Other considerations:<br />The analgesic effect of codeine is caused by the active metabolites morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide. Both codeine and the metabolite morphine result in suppression of the cough reflex.</p><p>Clinical consequences:<br />Five out of six adult UMs experienced codeine-induced side effects. In one case, this resulted in coma. Out of two neonates who received breast milk from mothers (UM) who used codeine, one died. The other exhibited extreme drowsiness and poor feeding behaviour, but recovered after switching completely to formula milk. In two cases, young children died of codeine-induced side effects following tonsillectomy due to obstructive sleep apnoea.<br />UMs experience more side effects. The percentage of people with sedation increased by 82%. In the case of breastfeeding mothers, the risk of central nervous system depression in mother and child increased with decreasing gene dose. This was not the case in a study in which codeine was used for a maximum of four days.</p><p>Kinetic consequences:<br />Morphine: increase in the AUC by 45% for UM + EM (gene dose &#8805; 2.5).

			<h4>Disclaimer and further information</h4>
			<h5>Guidelines and inference of recommendations</h5>

<p>The pharmacogenomic dosing recommendations are based on the guidelines developed by the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) of the Royal Dutch Pharmacists Association (KNMP). The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group formulates the optimal recommendations for each phenotype group based on the available scientific evidence. If this optimal recommendation cannot be followed due to practical restrictions, e.g. therapeutic drug monitoring or a lower dose is not available, the health care professional should consider the next best option. The recommendations do not take into account any other factors that can influence a patient's phenotype and drug response, such as drug-drug interactions, various health conditions or environmental factors. The absence of a recommendation for a specific drug is not to be equated with the general absence of variants that might influence an individual's response to this drug since the patient might have a rarer variant that is currently not covered by the U-PGx genotyping test.
The present tool matches phenotypes with therapeutic recommendations. The responsibility for inferring the correct pharmacogenomic phenotypes from raw genetic data lies solely with the user.
</p>
<p>The database that contains the annotations and recommendations to generate this report are continuously be updated as new scientific evidence becomes available. Therefore, the information included in this report is dependent on the report generation date.
</p>
<h5>Additional information on the recommendations for oral / vaginal contraceptives with estrogens</h5>

<p>The recommendation refers to all estrogen containing hormonal contraceptives for systemic use. This includes, but is not limited to, combination preparations of estrogens (e.g. ethinylestradiol, estradiol) with the following progestogens: Cyproteron, Desogestrel, Dienogest, Drospirenon, Etonogestrel, Gestodeen, Levonorgestrel, Nomegestrol, Norelgestromine, Norethisteron, Norgestimaat.

<h5>Origin and development of the PGx passport</h5>

        <p>The PGx Passport was developed with the intention to allow the continuation of evidence-based pharmacogenomics-guided drug dosing beyond the U-PGx Project. In the U-PGx project (<a href="http://www.upgx.eu" target="_blank">http://www.upgx.eu</a>) pre-emptive pharmacogenomic testing to guide drug and dose selection was implemented within a clinical study in seven European countries to provide evidence on the effect of pharmacogenomics-based prescribing on patient outcomes. In line with the projects goal – to make make effective treatment optimization accessible to every European citizen – this open-source tool was developed.
