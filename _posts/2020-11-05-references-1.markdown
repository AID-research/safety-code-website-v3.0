description: |
---

In collaboration with the German company 
<a href="https://www.biologis.com/" target="_blank">bio.logis</a>, the <a href="https://www.knmp.nl/knmp/about-knmp" target="_blank">Royal Dutch Pharmacists Association (KNMP)</a> and many clinical partners, the Medication Safety Code Card was
implemented as part of the U-PGx decision support infrastructure in seven European health care environments (The Netherlands, Spain, UK, Italy, Austria, Greece, Slovenia). 
The established infrastructure serves as the enabler of the U-PGx <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03093818" target="_blank">PREPARE</a> (PREemptive Pharmacogenomic Testing for Preventing Adverse Drug REactions) study which investigates if the emerging approach of pre-emptive genotyping of an entire panel of important PGx markers is cost-effective and results in a better outcome for patients.
